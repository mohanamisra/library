# Under the Covers Library   
This project was a basic practice in manipulating the DOM, utilising data from basic forms, and using javascript objects in a real-world scenario. This project only contains a front-end aspect.   
   
   I think a major (unintended even!) takeaway from this project was me learning to use and modify CSS animations (especially using keyframes).   
      
  It was also interesting to note how using just really basic UI/UX mockup skills makes the project look so much better and cleaner compared to starting out completely blind.
